Directory for Project 2

Includes all source and test code for a program designed to solve a Sudoku puzzle.

The requirements from the teaching staff were set out as follows:

The program should take input from text files containing either a partial or complete Sudoku puzzle.
The first line of every file indicates the size of the Sudoku puzzle -- i.e. the number of rows, columns, and squares (and, of course, the number of items in each square).

An incomplete puzzle is designated as having a '0' be a placeholder in any portion(s) of the puzzle. If a puzzle is incomplete, the program should first attempt to solve the puzzle. If the puzzle does not have a solution, the program will print 'Invalid.' If the puzzle is able to solved, the program will print the solved puzzle.

A complete puzzle is one in which we do not find a '0.' If the puzzle is complete, the program should attempt to verify that the puzzle is correct. If it is not, the program will output 'Invalid.' If the given puzzle turns out to be a correct solution, the program will print 'Valid.'
